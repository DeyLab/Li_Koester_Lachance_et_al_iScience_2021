This repo contains an R script providing examples of code used for data analysis and generating plots for our paper. An R readable version of Table S3 is also provided. R code for highly routine operations such as calculating t-test statistics and generating box-and-whisker plots are not shown. Please contact ndey@fredhutch.org if you have any additional questions.
